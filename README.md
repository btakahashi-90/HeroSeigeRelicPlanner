Testing the Repo.

As of 5/7/2022 - Using:

[Python 3.8.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/)

[postgreSQL 14.2](https://www.postgresql.org/)

The settings.py file for the Django project is NOT included, you will want to set-up your own database if you want to test this project.

PNG/IMAGE/ICON Files are not included. Make your own and put them in hsrp/builder/static/builder/images (or don't, up to you). Names are stored "in" the Relic DB Model.
